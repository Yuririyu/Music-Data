#README

This project consists of several Python scripts for managing and processing data related to musicians, albums, and instruments. The data is imported from a CSV file and stored in a SQLite database. The project is divided into multiple parts:

- **Task 1**: Importing original data into the database.
- **Task 2**: Designing and creating a new database schema based on an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
- **Task 3**: Populating the new database with data from the original database, breaking it into smaller related tables.
- **Summary**: Generating a summary report of musicians, albums, instruments, and album counts.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3 (Python module)

## Setup

1. Clone or download .py files to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the `no_town.csv` file available in the same directory as the scripts or adjust the file path in the scripts accordingly.

#### How to run:
You can load these scripts into a text editor like Sublime, N++ or some ide like VS.
Once loaded, run tasks 1-3. When done, run summary.py to get results/information.
When running summary.py make sure to scroll all the way to the end as some sections take up space.

can also run by launching through cmd, but more time consuming
```bash
python task1.py	
python task2.py	
python task3.py	
python summary.py
